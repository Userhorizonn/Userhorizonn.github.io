Dabbing is a Dabbing, or the Dab, is a simple dance move in which a person drops the head into the bent crook of a slanted arm,
often while raising the opposite arm in a parallel direction but out straight. Since 2015, it has also been used as a gesture of triumph or playfulness,
becoming a youthful American cultural sensation and Internet meme.
The move looks similar to someone sneezing into the "inside" of the elbow.[1][2]
